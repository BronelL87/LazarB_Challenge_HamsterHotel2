# Challenge: Hamster Hotel

**Description**: I created a hamster hotel site based off a prototype, I attempted to make the site look how it does on the prototype as well as implement responsiveness for tablet and mobile (Responsiveness is mostly complete mobile and tablet need to be tweaked)

### Peer Review

**Reviewer**: Chainarung Nathan Dechyothin  

**Reviewer Notes**: The desktop version closely resembles the prototype, and the responsiveness is very well-executed. Both tablet and mobile views look smooth, making for a seamless experience across devices. The code is clean and easy to read, with most styling efficiently managed in CSS. Overall, this is a well-done project!
